<p>After reading <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/books-developers-should-read.html">Four books professional developers should read</a>, by Phil Eaton, I was inspired to write my own engineering reading list.</p>
<p>Originally I thought of this as a “staff engineering” reading list,
because I probably wouldn’t have appreciated these earlier in my career.
 When starting out, my reading was mostly about the specifics of using
Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. Which was great, and worked well for me.</p>
<p>But while the books in this list have been useful for me as an
engineering leader, anybody at any level can get a lot out of them. Here
 they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201">A Philosophy of Software Design</a>, by Jon Ousterhout (ISBN 13: 978-1732102200).</p>
<p>A pretty short book about what abstraction is, and how to make good
abstractions. Even though the examples are written in C++, this has been
 very relevant to me for thinking about React components and design
systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madeline-Hunter%E2%80%B2s-Mastery-Teaching-Instructional/dp/076193930X/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/147-8104678-0634432?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=076193930X&amp;pd_rd_r=a2e03438-4ada-4d17-a987-642486853da7&amp;pd_rd_w=4AFJD&amp;pd_rd_wg=JBMNt&amp;pf_rd_p=16b28406-aa34-451d-8a2e-b3930ada000c&amp;pf_rd_r=G3W4M5X5PMF7RV0XEPJ5&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=G3W4M5X5PMF7RV0XEPJ5">Mastery Teaching</a>, by Madeline Hunter (ISBN: 978-0761939306).</p>
<p>A book about classroom teaching? Oh yes. So much of my job is
teaching. Not only by instructing others, but also by presentations and
documentation. Madeline’s masterpiece is full of ideas that I use every
day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0960191038/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">The Pyramid Principle</a>, by Barbara Minto (ISBN: 978-0960191031).</p>
<p>I’m still working through this one, which is about how to structure
your ideas when writing or presenting. What’s nice is even though it
comes from management consulting, it’s not about persuasion or
influence. It’s about communicating your ideas in the clearest way
possible. Communication is a large part of being an engineering leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-rsf-ajax1_0?cv_ct_cx=an+elegant+puzzle&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=an+elegant+puzzle&amp;pd_rd_i=1732265186&amp;pd_rd_r=e7985fab-03f6-4eda-9d26-6bb27c6ec9a9&amp;pd_rd_w=3jgif&amp;pd_rd_wg=ofssW&amp;pf_rd_p=5c711241-c674-4eef-b21c-fe6add670f33&amp;pf_rd_r=Z5QTBXZ11N7ABEMEQCPR&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1612484904&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1-e30f047d-8e3c-4340-8179-6a77ce88d756">An Elegant Puzzle</a>, by Will Larson (ISBN: 978-1732265189).</p>
<p>A book about engineering management may seem unusual for a list of
staff engineering books. I’m not advocating for engineers to take on
management tasks (unless they want to). But there is a lot of overlap,
and this book does a great job outlining approaches for things like
managing technical migrations, onboarding, and team dynamics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Two others that are great for specific interests are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>For computer science nerds</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IK3DGCITIT08&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=structure+and+interpretation+of+computer+programs&amp;qid=1612484971&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=structure+and+interpret%2Cstripbooks%2C216&amp;sr=1-1">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman (ISBN:  978-0262510875).</p>
<p>If using <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a>
 to dive in to computer science content from the 1980’s sounds like a
good time, check this classic out! No other book has inspired in me a
sense of wonder about computing as much as this one. On the other hand,
if this sounds terrible to you, there’s nothing wrong with skipping it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>For people working on web sites and apps</em></strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inclusive-Design-Patterns-Heydon-Pickering-ebook/dp/B01MAXK8XR/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=inclusive+design+patterns&amp;qid=1612485056&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3">Inclusive Design Patterns</a>, by Heydon Pickering (ISBN: 978-3-945749-43-2).</p>
<p>I work on accessibility, so am biased towards this pick. If you work
on websites or web applications, though, it’s the best I’ve found about
accessibility, covering the why and how (in HTML and CSS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these aren’t actually about writing code. For experienced engineers, technical skill is important. But also a given.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten to where we’re at in part because of technical skill.
The next level, however, also requires some more people, organization,
and communication skills. These books have helped me be more effective.</p>

<p>What do you think about these books? Which ones have been helpful for you? Are any missing from the list? Let me know!</p>
