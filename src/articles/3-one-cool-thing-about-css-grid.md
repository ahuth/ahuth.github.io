title: One Cool Thing About CSS Grid

One thing has blown my mind the most while learning [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout): using [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) to change the layout at different media queries.

Imagine something like:

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "head"
    "nav"
    "main"
    "footer"
}
```

And we can "see" that everything is lined up vertically.

At a different breakpoint, we can have a different layout:

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  #page {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      "header header"
      "nav main"
      "nav footer"
  }
}
```

ðŸ˜² This is amazing, because it's clear how the page is laid out at that breakpoint. See it live at [this codepen](https://codepen.io/ahuth/pen/dBewjV).
