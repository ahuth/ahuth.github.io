Here are some of my favorite articles about [accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility).

## 1. [Designing for Accessibility is Not That Hard](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94), by Pablo Stanley

One of my absolute favorite articles, Pablo describes 7 straightforward guidelines for building accessible web sites.

## 2. [Accessibility is Not a "React Problem"](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/), by Leslie Cohn-Wein

Makes the point that accessibility is not a constraint of trade-off, but a "philosophy" that helps us make good design choices for our users. And that if we're not going to do something right (accessibly), it's not worth doing at all.

## 4. [Creating an Accessibility Engineering Practice](https://blog.danielna.com/2017/09/14/creating-an-accessibility-engineering-practice.html), by Daniel Na

Such a great article, from a former engineering manager at Etsy. Covers a lot about how to make experiences accessible. And, most interestingly, changing engineering culture to result in accessibility.

It's all too easy to be focused on standards and practices, and to get disconnected from the experiences of actual users. Here we hear from users in their own words.
