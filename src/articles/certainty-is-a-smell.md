title: Certainty is a Smell

In software a code smell is a pattern that isn't necessarily problematic, but warrants further investigation to see if there are any issues. For example, a function that takes 10 parameters may be totally reasonable, but it could also point to poorly organized code. Recently I've been wondering if we can apply the same concept to more general topics.

Anecdotally, people tend to believe ideas that are said with a lot of confidence. Perhaps we like the certainty that a confident or strong leader offer. Or perhaps this gives us a shortcut to devote less mental resources towards developing our own thoughts.

Either way, I've started to view absolute certainty as a smell. When someone talks about their solution as the "right" one, or the "best" one, or the "only" one, it's time to start questioning and dig deeper. This doesn't mean that they're wrong. It also doesn't mean that we shouldn't all act with confidence, especially when we've put in the work to research and develop a good solution to a problem.

But look out for certainty in ourselves and others, and demand more evidence and do our own analysis.
