title: One Cool Thing About CSS Grid

One thing has amazed me the most while learning [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout): using [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) to change the layout at different media queries.

Imagine a mobile-first baseline of:

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "head"
    "nav"
    "main"
    "footer"
}
```

We can "see" that everything is lined up vertically.

At a different breakpoint, we can have a different layout:

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  #page {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      "header header"
      "nav main"
      "nav footer"
  }
}
```

ðŸ˜² This is amazing, because it's clear how the page is arranged at that breakpoint. See it live at [this codepen](https://codepen.io/ahuth/pen/dBewjV).

How easy was that? And now we have different layouts at different breakpoints, and can easily see what the difference between them is. Not to mention that writing this was very straighforward.
