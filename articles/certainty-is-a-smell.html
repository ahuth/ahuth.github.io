        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">Code smells</a> in software are patterns that aren't necessarily problematic, but warrant further investigation to see if there are any issues. For example, a function that takes 10 parameters may be totally reasonable, but could also point to poorly organized code. Recently I've been thinking about applying the same concept to more general topics.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, people tend to believe ideas that are said with a lot of confidence. Perhaps we like the certainty that a confident or strong leader offer. Or perhaps this gives us a shortcut to devote less mental resources towards developing our own thoughts.</p>
<p>Either way, I've started to view absolute certainty as a smell. When someone talks about their solution or ideas as the right, best, or only one, it's time to start questioning and dig deeper. This doesn't mean that they're wrong. And we <em>should</em> act with confidence, especially when we've put in the work to research and develop good solutions.</p>
<p>But look out for certainty in ourselves and others. Demand more evidence and do our own analysis before deciding what's right.</p>
