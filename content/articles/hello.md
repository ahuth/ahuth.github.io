From [God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_You,_Mr._Rosewater), by Kurt Vonnegut:

> Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies—God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.
